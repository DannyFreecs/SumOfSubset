# SumOfSubset
PVM-architect based c++ program determining that if exists any subset of a given set, where the sum of the elements equals to a given number. The program's using a divide&conquer approach with a recursive function that spawns new processes in each turn, until we have an answer from the last children processes.

If it finds a subset, then gives the answer 'May the subset be with you!',
else 'I find your lack of subset disturbing!'
